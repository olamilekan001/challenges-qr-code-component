## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
what i really learned was the proper use of the basic HTML and CSS knowledge i have. i got to discover how i can manipulate the tags and properties of HTML and CSS respectively to achieve what i want to create and i discover how to use the hsl color value of CSS.

### Continued development
In my future projects i want to continue developing on using all the basic knowledge and also build my advance projetcs with different frameworks and libraries.
